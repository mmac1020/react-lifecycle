# React Lifecycle

## About

We will learn about the component lifecycle of React class components.

Here is a [diagram](https://projects.wojtekmaj.pl/react-lifecycle-methods-diagram/) noting the lifecycle methods.

**In this demo, we will be going over**:
- `render`
- `componentDidMount`
- `componentWillUnmount`

**Other concepts that we will talk about are**:
- React list items
- Virtual DOM
- `ReactDOM.render` vs. `render`

For this demo, we will be using [`json-server`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/json-server). This will help us generate a fake REST API without needing a traditional database and using Express routes and Sequelize.

## To Run

Fork and clone this repo and `npm install` The same disclaimer from last time: Highly encouraged that you `git checkout end` to get the end point and follow along while taking notes instead of trying to type along with me from the starting point.

Then run, `npm run start`
